I am a machine learning engineer at Sensara Technologies, where I work on image/video content analysis using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

At Sensara[^1], I've worked on problems such as channel logo recognition, image quality analysis, object detection/recognition, face recognition, deep metric learning, image similarity, on-device machine learning. [^2]. (2018 - Present)

I did my bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering at <a href="https://www.pes.edu/" target="_blank">PES University</a>, Bangalore. (2014-2018)

Part from work, I enjoy reading books, running, traveling and trekking. I go for treks quite often and love being close to the nature.
